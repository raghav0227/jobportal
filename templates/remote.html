        <p>Remote companies are businesses that have a workforce that primarily works from outside of a traditional office setting. This means employees can work from home, co-working spaces, or any location with a good internet connection.

            There are a few different terms used to describe this type of work arrangement, including:
            <ul>
            <li>Remote work</li>
            <li>Telecommuting</li>
            <li>Virtual job</li>
            <li>Home-based job</li>

            </ul>
            These terms all basically mean the same thing: a job that doesn't require you to be in a physical office every day.
            
            Some companies are flily remote, meaning all of their employees work remotely. Others are hybrid, with some employees working remotely and others working in an office.</p>
